# CLAUDE.md

This repository is a minimal shared framework (rules, commands, templates).

Primary usage: vendored into project repositories (e.g. as a git submodule). The project repo is the working root.

Key directories:
- `rules/` — binding workspace rules
- `commands/` — reusable slash-command templates
- `templates/` — reusable templates
